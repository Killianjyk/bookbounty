    -Work on styling for discover users page.
        Should be in tables, with links to favorites, read next, previously read next to each user's username.
    -Finished writing codes for 404 page.
        If an endpoint does not exist it will redirect users to this error page.
        Users will have an option to go back to the previous page.
    -Changed the message after user updates their account information on user detail page.
    -Might be making a profile page during stretch week. It will have the list of all the reviews.

    -Worked on user detail page. There are issues where after the user updates their account info, it does send data back to the backedn
        but does not automatically update on the frontend. This is most likely due to authentication issue (token). User information updates
        when the user logs out and logs back in. We are currently settling for creating a message indicating that the information will update after re-logging in.
    -Will be asking questions on whether we can make a new token when updating the account info. It will be during stretch week.

# 6/2

    -next week have SEIRS/Instructors in the room to take a look at our codes
